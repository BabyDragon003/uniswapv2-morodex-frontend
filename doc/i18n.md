# Localisation

Keys should be added to translation.json file, in order to be translated to other languages.

## Adding translations

A hook expose the function you need to translate content.

```
import { useTranslation } from '@pancakeswap/localization'
### Dynamic variables Example

If a Crowdin translation like this `You have %num% left in your wallet` - would look something like:

```
t(`You have %num% left in your wallet`, { num: cakeBalance })
```
